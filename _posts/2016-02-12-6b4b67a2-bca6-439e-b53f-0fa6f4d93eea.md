Silver Lining Cloud Solutions approached Start Digital for a range of digital solutions, all of which required a rapid turnaround to align with their work schedule. In the space of 10 days we were able to design and deliver a new company logo, a fully responsive website, a business card design and an animated video to showcase their range of cloud based services to a West Australian audience. Start Digital continue to work with Silver Lining on developing their digital profile and look forward to a long and fruitful partnership
